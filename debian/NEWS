ifupdown (0.7~rc1+experimental) experimental; urgency=low

    The --all option to ifup and ifquery can now be combined with the
    --allow option to act on all interfaces of a specific class (still
    defaulting to the class 'auto'). If you have custom hook scripts, you
    may need to update them. See interfaces(5) for details.
